"We are about to study the idea of a computational process. Computational processes
are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate
other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern
of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, <b>we
conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.</b>"
